# Firewall [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#firewall)

Coolify requires specific network ports to be open in order to function properly across various environments. These ports enable web access, SSH connections, terminal sessions, and real-time communication.

The required ports may vary slightly depending on whether you're using a self-hosted setup or the managed version ([Coolify Cloud](https://coolify.io/pricing/)).

## Coolify Self-hosted [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#coolify-self-hosted)

To ensure proper functionality when self-hosting Coolify, the following ports should be opened:

-   **8000** – HTTP access to the Coolify dashboard
-   **6001** – Real-time communications
-   **6002** – Terminal access (Required for Coolify version 4.0.0-beta.336 and above)
-   **22** – SSH access (or your custom SSH port)
-   **80** – SSL certificate generation via reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy)
-   **443** – HTTPS traffic

These ports are required if you're accessing Coolify directly using your server’s IP address (e.g., `http://<SERVER_IP>:8000`).

Tip

If you're using a custom domain with Coolify’s integrated reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy), you can safely close ports **8000**, **6001**, and **6002** after accesing the dashboard from your custom domain.

Caution

If you are using `Oracle Cloud Free ARM Server`, you need to allow these ports inside Oracle's Dashboard, otherwise you cannot reach your instance from the internet after installation.

## Coolify Cloud [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#coolify-cloud)

For Servers connected to Coolify Cloud, the following ports must be open:

-   **22** – SSH access (or your custom SSH port)
-   **80** – SSL certificate generation via reverse proxy (Traefik or Caddy)
-   **443** – HTTPS traffic

These are the only required ports, as all other services are managed for you by Coolify Cloud.

## Closing Ports Using a Firewall [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#closing-ports-using-a-firewall)

Coolify runs on Docker, which uses NAT-based iptables rules that can bypass traditional Linux firewalls like UFW. As a result, blocking ports using UFW alone will not be effective.

### Recommended Approach [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#recommended-approach)

Most cloud providers offer integrated firewalls through their dashboards. If your provider supports this, **it is highly recommended to use their firewall settings** to manage open ports instead of relying on local tools like UFW.

If your provider does not offer firewall functionality, you can use one of the following advanced methods:

### Coolify Self-hosted [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#coolify-self-hosted-1)

CAUTION!!

Modifying firewall settings incorrectly may lead to access issues that are difficult to recover from.

Proceed with the following steps **only if necessary**, and if you fully understand the implications.

#### Use `ufw-docker` [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#use-ufw-docker)

[ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) is a community-maintained tool that helps bridge UFW and Docker by allowing you to block specific ports effectively. Refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) for complete setup instructions

### Coolify Cloud [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#coolify-cloud-1)

For servers connected to Coolify Cloud, only the SSH port (typically **22**) needs to be open for remote management.

If you wish to restrict access based on IP address, we have a list of public IPs used by Coolify Cloud:

-   [IPv4 addresses](https://coolify.io/ipv4.txt)
-   [IPv6 addresses](https://coolify.io/ipv6.txt)

Coolify Cloud’s IPs rarely change, but users will be notified by email if updates occur.

### GitHub Integration [​](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall#github-integration)

GitHub uses webhooks to communicate with Coolify. For this to work correctly:

-   Ensure **TCP ports 80 and 443** are open.
-   (Optional) To restrict webhook access by IP, you can get the current list of GitHub’s outbound IPs from: [https://api.github.com/meta](https://api.github.com/meta) (Check the `hooks` section)

For more details, refer to their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-githubs-ip-addresses)
