# VibeStack - OCI Always Free Deployments

Deploy KASM Workspaces and/or Coolify on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using only Always Free tier resources.

VibeStack can be deployed in different configurations to match your needs. All deployment options utilize [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][oci] Always Free tier resources that can be used indefinitely.

## Single Server Deployments

Choose one of these options if you want to deploy just a single server and keep half your Always Free resources available for other uses.

### VibeStack Coolify
- **What**: Self-hosted application deployment platform (like Vercel/Netlify/Heroku)
- **Resources**: VM.Standard.A1.Flex (2 OCPUs, 12GB RAM, 100GB storage)
- **Perfect for**: Developers wanting their own PaaS for deploying Docker containers, static sites, and databases
- **Ports**: 22 (SSH), 80/443 (HTTP/S), 3000 (Coolify UI)

### VibeStack KASM
- **What**: Browser-based remote workspace server with containerized desktops
- **Resources**: VM.Standard.A1.Flex (2 OCPUs, 12GB RAM, 60GB storage)
- **Perfect for**: Remote development environments, secure browsing, virtual desktops
- **Ports**: 22 (SSH), 80/443 (HTTP/S), plus any custom ports you configure

## VibeStack Full

The complete deployment uses your full Always Free allocation to run both servers together.

- **KASM Server**: Remote workspace hosting (2 OCPUs, 12GB RAM, 60GB storage)
- **Coolify Server**: App deployment platform (2 OCPUs, 12GB RAM, 100GB storage)
- **Shared Infrastructure**: VCN, subnet, internet gateway, and security rules
- **Total Resources**: 4 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, 160GB storage (80% of free tier)

## üîß All Packages Include

- **Custom compartment** (you name it during deployment)
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** (or Oracle Linux option)
- **Public networking** with security groups
- **SSH access** with your public key
- **Always Free tier compatible** - no charges

## üìñ Documentation

- [VibeStack Recommended Setup](docs/oci-vibestack-recommended-setup.md)
- [Deploy Button Specification](docs/deploy-button-specification.md)
- [Termius Import Generator](docs/termius-import.md) - Generate SSH client import files
- [Log Management](docs/log-management.md) - Secure handling of deployment logs

## üîß Post-Deployment Tools

### Option 1: Direct Import (if Terraform is available)

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./generate-termius-import.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\generate-termius-import.ps1
```

### Option 2: From Saved Logs (recommended for OCI Resource Manager)

```bash
# 1. Save your deployment log securely
./manage-deployment-logs.sh save-state path/to/terraform-state.txt

# 2. Generate import files from saved log
./manage-deployment-logs.sh import-from-log

# 3. Import to Termius, then cleanup
./manage-deployment-logs.sh cleanup
```

This workflow securely handles sensitive deployment data and creates import files for Termius or other SSH clients. All log files are Git-ignored for security. See the [Log Management documentation](docs/log-management.md) for details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Deployment

If you prefer Terraform CLI instead of the deploy buttons:

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/evolv3ai/oci-cloudnative.git
cd oci-cloudnative/clean-vibestack/terraform/vibestack  # or coolify-only/ or kasm-only/

# Configure
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your OCI credentials

# Deploy
terraform init
terraform apply

# Cleanup when done
terraform destroy
```

## üßπ Resource Cleanup

For complete resource removal when Terraform state is lost or corrupted:

```bash
# Complete compartment cleanup (IRREVERSIBLE!)
./cleanup-compartment.sh <compartment-ocid>

# Example:
./cleanup-compartment.sh ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaae5v3sal4r6df2hrucviwerue5k3trdiln5buhh7wggjjgw2f7wua
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This script permanently deletes ALL resources in the specified compartment. It follows proper dependency order to avoid hanging deletions:

1. Volume attachments ‚Üí 2. Compute instances ‚Üí 3. Block volumes ‚Üí 4. Boot volumes
5. Load balancers ‚Üí 6. Subnets ‚Üí 7. Internet gateways ‚Üí 8. Route tables
9. Security lists ‚Üí 10. VCNs ‚Üí 11. Compartment

## üí° Why VibeStack?

- **Always Free**: Uses Oracle Cloud's generous Always Free tier
- **Proven Stack**: KASM + Coolify is a powerful combination
- **Compartmentalized**: Clean organization with custom naming
- **Ubuntu**: Modern, well-supported OS with excellent ARM compatibility
- **One-Click**: Deploy buttons make it trivial to get started
